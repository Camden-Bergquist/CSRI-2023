<h2>Observational studies and experiments</h2>
<p>In this lesson, we discuss two types of studies commonly used in
scientific research: observational studies and experiments. In
particular, we will outline how to identify them and what the type of
study says about the scope of the inference we can make based on that
study’s results.</p>
<p>In an <em>observational study</em>, researchers collect data in a way
that does not directly interfere with how the data arise, in other
words, they merely “observe”. And based on an observational study we can
only establish an association between the <em>explanatory</em> and
<em>response</em> variables.</p>
<p>In an <em>experiment</em>, on the other hand, researchers randomly
assign subjects to various treatments and can therefore establish causal
connections between the <em>explanatory</em> and <em>response</em>
variables.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to evaluate the relationship between using screens at
bedtime such as a computer, tablet, or phone and attention span during
the day. We can design this study as an observational study or as an
experiment.</p>
<p>In an observational study, we sample two types of people from the
population: those who choose to use screens at bedtime and those who
don’t.</p>
<p>Then, we find the average attention span for the two groups of people
and compare.</p>
<p><img src="images/design-observational.png" style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, in an experiment, we sample a group of people from
the population and then we randomly assign these people into two groups:
those who are asked to use screens at bedtime and those who asked not to
use them. The difference is that the decision of whether to use screens
or not is not left up to the subjects, as it was in the observational
study, but is instead imposed by the researcher.</p>
<p>At the end, we compare the attention spans of the two groups.</p>
<p><img src="images/design-experiment.png" style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<p>Based on the observational study, even if we find a difference
between the average attention span of these two groups of people, we
can’t attribute this difference solely to using screens because there
may be other variables that we didn’t control for in this study that
contribute to the observed difference. For example, people who use
screens at night might also be using screens for longer time periods
during the day and their attention span might be affected by the daytime
usage as well.</p>
<p>However, in the experiment, such variables that might also contribute
to the outcome, called confounding variables, are most likely
represented equally in the two groups due to random assignment.
Therefore, if we find a difference between the two averages, we can
indeed make a causal statement attributing this difference to bedtime
screen usage.</p>
<p>Let’s put these ideas into practice.</p>

<h3>Identify type of study: Reading speed and font</h3>
<p>A study is designed to evaluate whether people read text faster in
Arial or Helvetica font. A group of volunteers who agreed to be a part
of the study are randomly assigned to two groups: one where they read
some text in Arial, and another where they read the same text in
Helvetica. At the end, average reading speeds from the two groups are
compared.</p>

<div id="section-random-sampling-assignment" class="section level2">
<h2>Random sampling assignment</h2>
<p>In this section, we’ll clarify the difference between <em>random
sampling</em> and <em>random assignment</em>, and more importantly, why
we care about this difference.</p>
<p><strong>Random sampling</strong> occurs when <em>subjects are being
selected for a study</em>. If subjects are selected randomly from the
population of interest, then the resulting sample is likely
representative of that population and therefore the study’s results can
be generalizable to that population.</p>
<p><strong>Random assignment</strong> occurs only <em>in experimental
settings where subjects are being assigned to various treatments</em>.
Random assignment <em>allows for causal conclusions</em> about the
relationship between the treatment and the response.</p>
<p>Here is a quick summary of how random sampling and random assignment
affect the scope of inference of a study’s results.</p>
<div id="section-scope-of-inference" class="section level4">
<h4>Scope of inference</h4>
<p><img src="images/scope-inference.png" style="width:70.0%" /></p>
<p>A study that employs random sampling and random assignment can be
used to make causal conclusions and these conclusions can be generalized
to the whole population. This would be an ideal experiment, but such
studies are usually difficult to carry out, especially if the
experimental units are humans, since it may be difficult to randomly
sample people from the population and then impose treatments on them.
This is why most experiments recruit volunteer subjects. You may have
seen ads for these on a university campus or in a newspaper.</p>
<p>Such human experiments that rely on volunteers employ random
assignment, but not random sampling. These studies can be used to make
causal conclusions, but the conclusions only apply to the sample and the
results cannot be generalized to the population.</p>
<p>A study that uses no random assignment, but does use random sampling
is your typical observational study. Results can only be used to make
association statements, but they can be generalized to the whole
population.</p>
<p>A final type of study, one that doesn’t use random assignment or
random sampling, can only be used to make non causal association
statements. This is an unideal observational study.</p>
<p>You’ll get some more practice with these concepts now.</p>

<h3>Random sampling and random assignment?</h3>
<p>One of the early studies linking smoking and lung cancer compared
patients who are already hospitalized with lung cancer to similar
patients without lung cancer (hospitalized for other reasons), and
recorded whether each patient smoked. Then, proportions of smokers for
patients with and without lung cancer were compared.</p>

<h3>Identify the scope of inference of study</h3>
<p>Volunteers were recruited to participate in a study where they were
asked to type 40 bits of trivia—for example, “an ostrich’s eye is bigger
than its brain”—into a computer. A randomly selected half of these
subjects were told the information would be saved in the computer; the
other half were told the items they typed would be erased.</p>
<p>Then, the subjects were asked to remember these bits of trivia, and
the number of bits of trivia each subject could correctly recall were
recorded. It was found that the subjects were significantly more likely
to remember information if they thought they would not be able to find
it later.</p>
